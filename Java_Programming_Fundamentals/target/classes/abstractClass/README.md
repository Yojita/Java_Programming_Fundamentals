# Abstract Class

An abstract class cannot be instantiated using the new keyword.

The subclass of abstract class can be only instantiated if only if it provides the implementations for all the abstract methods.

If a class has at least one abstract method then the class must be declared as abstract.

If the subclass does not implement all the abstract method then the subclass must also be declared as abstract.

An abstract class can also have abstract methods, i.e. methods with implementation.

An abstract class reference can be assigned an object of its subclass, thereby achieving run time polymorphism.
