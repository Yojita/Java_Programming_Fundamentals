#Inheritance
The mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.

Inheritance helps to improve reusability of the code.

Inheritance represents an is-a relationship between two real world objects.

A subclass inherits the member-variables and the member methods of superclass.

Inheritance can be single-level or multi-level (Java does not support multiple inheritance in the form of classes)

keyword extends is used by the child class to inherit the behavior of the parent

An object can access its own data as well as (non-private) data of its super class.
