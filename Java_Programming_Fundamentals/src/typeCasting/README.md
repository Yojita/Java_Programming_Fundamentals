#Widening and Narrowing

In java one datatype can receive value of another datatype.This is possible through implicit and explicit conversion.

There are two types of conversions.

1. Widening Conversion / implicit type casting : converting variable of smaller datatype to the larger datatype, without data loss.

2. Narrowing Conversion / explicit type casting : converting variable of larger datatype to the smaller datatype, with some data loss.

InstanceOf Operator : used to check whether the object is an instance of specified class or subclass or interface. It return boolean value.
If we apply instanceOf operator to any variable that has a null value, it will return false.

It is safe to use instanceOf operator before type casting to avoid runtime exceptions

A boolean cannot be cast to any other data type and vice versa.
