Objects can't be created for interface and an interface cannot have private or protected members.

In an interface all methods are implicitly public and abstract and variables are implicitly public, static and final. 

The classes which implement interface has to provide definitions for all abstract methods.

Inheritance is possible in an interface and it supports multiple inheritance.
