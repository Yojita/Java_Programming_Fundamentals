# Enhanced For Loop
Traversing through array elements can also be done using specialized for loop called enhanced for loop.

Prefer using for each loop for better readability.

A normal for loop using the index is faster than a for-each loop, as for-each loop creates interior internally to iterate through the elements.

Can't use for-each loop when :

You have to modify or delete the collection or array selectively.

You need to iterate through more than one collection in parallel.
